#These are the result of fitting a certain predictive model to prices of used Toyota Corolla cars. The training set includes 600 cars and the validation set includes 400 cars. Results are displayed separately for the training and validation sets. We can see from the histogram and boxplot corresponding to the validation set that most errors are in the [−1000, 1000] range, with a few large positive (under-prediction) errors

#Illustrate concept  called ranking, consider a car rental firm that renews its fleet regularly so that customers drive late-model cars. This entails disposing of a large quantity of used vehicles on a continuing basis. Since the firm is not primarily in the used car sales business, it tries to dispose of as much of its fleet as possible through volume sales to used car dealers. However, it is
profitable to sell a limited number of cars through its own channels. Its volume
deals with the used car dealers allow it flexibility to pick and choose which cars
to sell in this fashion, so it would like to have a model for selecting cars for resale through its own channels. Since all cars were purchased some time ago and the deals with the used car dealers are for fixed prices (specifying a given number of cars of a certain make and model class), the cars’ costs are now irrelevant and the dealer is interested only in maximizing revenue. This is done by selecting for its own resale, the cars likely to generate the most revenue. The lift chart in this case gives the predicted lift for revenue.
